  abstract  = {The initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication is regulated by three protein kinase classes: cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) and the DNA damage checkpoint kinases1. CDK phosphorylation of two key initiation factors, Sld2 and Sld3, promotes essential interactions with Dpb11 (refs 2???4), whereas DDK acts by phosphorylating subunits of the Mcm2-7 helicase5. CDK has an additional role in replication by preventing the re-loading of Mcm2-7 during the S, G2 and M phases6, thus preventing origin re-firing and re-replication. During the G1 phase, both CDK and DDK are downregulated, which allows origin licensing and prevents premature replication initiation3. Origin firing is also inhibited during the S phase when DNA damage or replication fork stalling activates the checkpoint kinases7,8,9,10. Here we show that, analogous to the situation in the G1 phase, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint kinase Rad53 inhibits both CDK- and DDK-dependent pathways, which acts redundantly to block further origin firing. Rad53 acts on DDK directly by phosphorylating Dbf4, whereas the CDK pathway is blocked by Rad53-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream CDK substrate, Sld3. This allows CDK to remain active during the S phase in the presence of DNA damage, which is crucial to prevent re-loading of Mcm2-7 onto origins that have already fired6. Our results explain how checkpoints regulate origin firing and demonstrate that the slowing of S phase by the ???intra-S checkpoint??? is primarily due to the inhibition of origin firing.},

  abstract = {DNA replication origins strikingly differ between eukaryotic species and cell types. Origins are localized and can be highly efficient in budding yeast, are randomly located in early fly and frog embryos, which do not transcribe their genomes, and are clustered in broad (10-100 kb) non-transcribed zones, frequently abutting transcribed genes, in mammalian cells. Nonetheless, in all cases, origins are established during the G1-phase of the cell cycle by the loading of double hexamers of the Mcm 2-7 proteins (MCM DHs), the core of the replicative helicase. MCM DH activation in S-phase leads to origin unwinding, polymerase recruitment, and initiation of bidirectional DNA synthesis. Although MCM DHs are initially loaded at sites defined by the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC), they ultimately bind chromatin in much greater numbers than ORC and only a fraction are activated in any one S-phase. Data suggest that the multiplicity and functional redundancy of MCM DHs provide robustness to the replication process and affect replication time and that MCM DHs can slide along the DNA and spread over large distances around the ORC. Recent studies further show that MCM DHs are displaced along the DNA by collision with transcription complexes but remain functional for initiation after displacement. Therefore, eukaryotic DNA replication relies on intrinsically mobile and flexible origins, a strategy fundamentally different from bacteria but conserved from yeast to human. These properties of MCM DHs likely contribute to the establishment of broad, intergenic replication initiation zones in higher eukaryotes.},

How eukaryotic origin positions are specified remains elusive. Here we show that, contrary to the bacterial paradigm, eukaryotic replication origins are not irrevocably defined by selection of the helicase loading site, but can shift in position after helicase loading. Using purified proteins we show that DNA translocases, including RNA polymerase, can push budding yeast Mcm2-7 double hexamers along DNA. Displaced Mcm2-7 double hexamers support DNA replication initiation distal to the loading site in vitro. Similarly, in yeast cells that are defective for transcription termination, collisions with RNA polymerase induce a redistribution of Mcm2-7 complexes along the chromosomes, resulting in a corresponding shift in DNA replication initiation sites. These results reveal a eukaryotic origin specification mechanism that departs from the classical replicon model, helping eukaryotic cells to negotiate transcription-replication conflict.},

  abstract  = {The origin recognition complex (ORC) binds sites from which DNA replication is initiated. We address ORC binding selectivity in vivo by mapping ???52,000 ORC2 binding sites throughout the human genome. The ORC binding profile is broader than those of sequence-specific transcription factors, suggesting that ORC is not bound or recruited to specific DNA sequences. Instead, ORC binds nonspecifically to open (DNase I-hypersensitive) regions containing active chromatin marks such as H3 acetylation and H3K4 methylation. ORC sites in early and late replicating regions have similar properties, but there are far more ORC sites in early replicating regions. This suggests that replication timing is due primarily to ORC density and stochastic firing of origins. Computational simulation of stochastic firing from identified ORC sites is in accord with replication timing data. Large genomic regions with a paucity of ORC sites are strongly associated with common fragile sites and recurrent deletions in cancers. We suggest that replication origins, replication timing, and replication-dependent chromosome breaks are determined primarily by the genomic distribution of activator proteins at enhancers and promoters. These activators recruit nucleosome-modifying complexes to create the appropriate chromatin structure that allows ORC binding and subsequent origin firing.},

  abstract   = {Hydroxyurea (HU) is a DNA replication inhibitor that negatively affects both the elongation and initiation phases of replication and triggers the intra-S phase checkpoint. Previous work with budding yeast has shown that, during a short exposure to HU, MEC1/RAD53 prevent initiation at some late S phase origins. In this study, we have performed microarray experiments to follow the fate of all origins over an extended exposure to HU. We show that the genome-wide progression of DNA synthesis, including origin activation, follows the same pattern in the presence of HU as in its absence, although the time frames are very different. We find no evidence for a specific effect that excludes initiation from late origins. Rather, HU causes S phase to proceed in slow motion; all temporal classes of origins are affected, but the order in which they become active is maintained. We propose a revised model for the checkpoint response to HU that accounts for the continued but slowed pace of the temporal program of origin activation.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional pulsing has been observed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and plays a crucial role in cell-to-cell variability of protein and mRNA numbers. An important issue is how the time constants associated with episodes of transcriptional bursting and mRNA and protein degradation rates lead to different cellular mRNA and protein distributions, starting from the transient regime leading to the steady state. We address this by deriving and then investigating the exact time-dependent solution of the master equation for a transcriptional pulsing model of mRNA distributions. We find a plethora of results. We show that, among others, bimodal and long-tailed (power-law) distributions occur in the steady state as the rate constants are varied over biologically significant time scales. Since steady state may not be reached experimentally we present results for the time evolution of the distributions. Because cellular behavior is determined by proteins, we also investigate the effect of the different mRNA distributions on the corresponding protein distributions using numerical simulations.},

Here, we review our knowledge of genome organization into single and multiple replicons in bacteria, archaea and eukarya. Bacterial and archaeal replicator/initiator systems are quite specific and efficient, whereas eukaryotic replicons show degenerate specificity and efficiency, allowing for complex regulation of origin firing time. We expand on recent evidence that {\textasciitilde} 50\% of the human genome is organized as {\textasciitilde} 1,500 megabase-sized replication domains with a characteristic parabolic (U-shaped) replication timing profile and linear (N-shaped) gradient of replication fork polarity. These N/U-domains correspond to self-interacting segments of the chromatin fiber bordered by open chromatin zones and replicate by cascades of origin firing initiating at their borders and propagating to their center, possibly by fork-stimulated initiation. The conserved occurrence of this replication pattern in the germline of mammals has resulted over evolutionary times in the formation of megabase-sized domains with an N-shaped nucleotide compositional skew profile due to replication-associated mutational asymmetries. Overall, these results reveal an evolutionarily conserved but developmentally plastic organization of replication that is driving mammalian genome evolution.},

In Chinese hamster cells most of these sections are probably less than 30 . long, and the rate of DNA replication per growing point is 2.5 per minute or less. In addition, we have taken advantage of the apparent slowness of equilibration with external thymidine of the internal thymidine triphosphate pool in Chinese hamster cells to determine the direction of DNA synthesis at the conclusion of the pulse in pulse-chase experiments. We have found, unexpectedly, that replication seems to proceed in opposite directions at adjacent growing points.

Despite this apparent randomness, the spacing of these numerous initiation sites must be sufficiently regular for the genome to be completely replicated on time. Studies in various eukaryotes have revealed that there is a strict temporal separation of origin licensing prior to S phase and origin activation during S phase. This may suggest that replicon size must be already established at the licensing stage. However, recent experiments suggest that a large excess of potential origins are assembled along chromatin during licensing. Thus, a regular replicon size may result from the selection of origins during S phase.

  abstract = {Although chromatin folding is known to be of functional importance to control the gene expression program, less is known regarding its interplay with DNA replication. Here, using Circular Chromatin Conformation Capture combined with high-throughput sequencing, we identified megabase-sized self-interacting domains in the nucleus of a human lymphoblastoid cell line, as well as in cycling and resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Strikingly, the boundaries of those domains coincide with early-initiation zones in every cell types. Preferential interactions have been observed between the consecutive early-initiation zones, but also between those separated by several tens of megabases. Thus, the 3D conformation of chromatin is strongly correlated with the replication timing along the whole chromosome. We furthermore provide direct clues that, in addition to the timing value per se , the shape of the timing profile at a given locus defines its set of genomic contacts. As this timing-related scheme of chromatin organization exists in lymphoblastoid cells, resting and cycling PBMC, this indicates that it is maintained several weeks or months after the previous S-phase. Lastly, our work highlights that the major chromatin changes accompanying PBMC entry into cell cycle occur while keeping largely unchanged the long-range chromatin contacts.},

These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term /`topological domains/', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic chromosomes replicate in a temporal order known as the replication-timing program. During mammalian development, at least half the genome changes replication timing, primarily in units of 400-800 kb (replication domains; RDs), whose positions are preserved in different cell types, conserved between species, and appear to confine long-range effects of chromosome rearrangements. Early and late replication correlate strongly with open and closed chromatin compartments identified by high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and, to a lesser extent, lamina-associated domains (LADs),,,. Recent Hi-C mapping has unveiled a substructure of topologically-associating domains (TADs) that are largely conserved in their positions between cell types and are similar in size to RDs,. However, TADs can be further sub-stratified into smaller domains, challenging the significance of structures at any particular scale,. Moreover, attempts to reconcile TADs and LADs to replication-timing data have not revealed a common, underlying domain structure,,. Here, we localize boundaries of RDs to the early-replicating border of replication-timing transitions and map their positions in 18 human and 13 mouse cell types. We demonstrate that, collectively, RD boundaries share a near one-to-one correlation with TAD boundaries, whereas within a cell type, adjacent TADs that replicate at similar times obscure RD boundaries, largely accounting for the previously reported lack of alignment. Moreover, cell-type specific replication timing of TADs partitions the genome into two large-scale sub-nuclear compartments revealing that replication-timing transitions are indistinguishable from late-replicating regions in chromatin composition and lamina association and accounting for the reduced correlation of replication timing to LADs and heterochromatin. Our results reconcile cell type specific sub-nuclear compartmentalization with developmentally stable chromosome domains and offer a unified model for large-scale chromosome structure and function.},

Here we report the results of a combined multiscale analysis of genome-wide mean replication timing and chromatin conformation data that reveal some intimate relationships between chromatin folding and human DNA replication. We previously described megabase replication N/U-domains as mammalian multiorigin replication units, and showed that their borders are master replication initiation zones that likely initiate cascades of origin firing responsible for the stereotypic replication of these domains. Here, we demonstrate that replication N/U-domains correspond to the structural domains of self-interacting chromatin, and that their borders act as insulating regions both in high-throughput 3C (Hi-C) data and high-resolution 3C (4C) experiments. Further analyses of Hi-C data using a graph-theoretical approach reveal that N/U-domain borders are long-distance, interconnected hubs of the chromatin interaction network. Overall, these results and the observation that a well-defined ordering of chromatin states exists from N/U-domain borders to centers suggest that master replication initiation zones are at the heart of a high-order, epigenetically controlled 3D organization of the human genome.},

	since {DNA} replication origins are located and activated stochastically,
	leading to the random completion problem. {DNA} combing, kinetic
	modelling and other studies using {X}enopus egg extracts have suggested
	that potential origins are much more abundant than actual initiation
	events and that the time-dependent rate of initiation, {I}(t), markedly
	increases through {S} phase to ensure the rapid completion of unreplicated
	gaps and a narrow distribution of completion times. {H}owever, the
	molecular mechanism that underlies this increase has remained obscure.
	{METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: {U}sing both previous and novel
	{DNA} combing data we have confirmed that {I}(t) increases through
	{S} phase but have also established that it progressively decreases
	before the end of {S} phase. {T}o explore plausible biochemical scenarios
	that might explain these features, we have performed comparisons
	between numerical simulations and {DNA} combing data. {S}everal simple
	models were tested: i) recycling of a limiting replication fork component
	from completed replicons; ii) time-dependent increase in origin efficiency;
	iii) time-dependent increase in availability of an initially limiting
	factor, e.g. by nuclear import. {N}one of these potential mechanisms
	could on its own account for the data. {W}e propose a model that
	combines time-dependent changes in availability of a replication
	factor and a fork-density dependent affinity of this factor for potential
	origins. {T}his novel model quantitatively and robustly accounted
	for the observed changes in initiation rate and fork density. {CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}:
	{T}his work provides a refined temporal profile of replication initiation
	rates and a robust, dynamic model that quantitatively explains replication
	origin usage during early embryonic {S} phase. {T}hese results have

	that this epigenetic mark is not crucial for defining the activated
	origin. Initiation of DNA synthesis starts at the borders of CGI,

	detected, which are good predictors of Oris, suggesting that common

	chromosome 4 of Drosophila, Oris correlated with HP1 binding sites.
	At the chromosome level, regions rich in Oris are early replicating,
	whereas Ori-poor regions are late replicating. The genome-wide analysis
	was coupled with a DNA combing analysis to unravel the organization

	their activation does not occur at random. They are organized in
	groups of site-specific but flexible origins that define replicons,
	where a single origin is activated in each replicon. This organization
	provides both site specificity and Ori firing flexibility in each

We further examine the link between transcription and origin firing and reveal that modulation of origin activity across cell types is intimately linked to cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. Our study unravels conserved origin features and provides unique insights into the relationship among DNA topology, chromatin, transcription, and replication initiation across metazoa.},

Synthesis of DNA in euchromatic and heterochromatic regions of Drosophila diploid cells occurs at different periods of the S phase which last 10 h. During the first 4 h the synthesis is observed only in euchromatic regions. The heterochromatic synthesis starts shortly before the synthesis in euchromatic regions is completed and lasts for 6 h until the end of the S phase. The cells were synchronized by 5-fluorodeoxyuridine which blocked the diploid cell DNA synthesis. Synthesis was found to start simultaneously in most euchromatic replicons. In the majority of the replicons the synthesis started at a single point and proceeded bidirectionally. The average rate of DNA synthesis per fork was 12.5 mum/h (38kb). The mean distance between the middle points of adjacent labeled regions was 70 mgm (210 kb). The size of most replicons ranged from 40 to 120 mum. - These estimates do not apply to the heterochromatic portions of the D. melanogaster genome since the measurements have been carried out on DNA preparations obtained during the first 2 h of the S phase. - On the average, a replicon can consist of 7 chromomeres since the size of a replicon in diploid cell chromosomal DNA and DNA length of a polytene chromomere average 210 and 30 kb, respectively.},

The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For "ordinary" chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called "the reaction probability density function". The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications.},

Using fission yeast, we report the first genome-wide analysis of the spatial and temporal organization of replication origin firing, analyzed using single DNA molecules that can approach the full length of chromosomes. At S-phase onset, origins fire randomly and sparsely throughout the chromosomes. Later in S-phase, clusters of fired origins appear embedded in the sparser regions, which form the basis of nuclear replication foci. The formation of clusters requires proper histone methylation and acetylation, and their locations are not inherited between cell cycles. The rate of origin firing increases gradually, peaking just before mid S-phase. Toward the end of S-phase, nearly all the available origins within the unreplicated regions are fired, contributing to the timely completion of genome replication. We propose that the majority of origins do not fire as a part of a deterministic program. Instead, origin firing, both individually and as clusters, should be viewed as being mostly stochastic.},

Forkhead regulation of origin timing is independent of local levels or changes of transcription. Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories. Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins.

We solve this problem with a new imaging approach called PhADE (PhotoActivation, Diffusion and Excitation). A protein of interest is fused to a photoactivatable protein (mKikGR) and introduced to its surface-immobilized substrate. After photoactivation of mKikGR near the surface, rapid diffusion of the unbound mKikGR fusion out of the detection volume eliminates background fluorescence, whereupon the bound molecules are imaged. We labeled the eukaryotic DNA replication protein flap endonuclease 1 with mKikGR and added it to replication-competent Xenopus laevis egg extracts. PhADE imaging of high concentrations of the fusion construct revealed its dynamics and micrometer-scale movements on individual, replicating DNA molecules. Because PhADE imaging is in principle compatible with any photoactivatable fluorophore, it should have broad applicability in revealing single-molecule dynamics and stoichiometry of macromolecular protein complexes at previously inaccessible fluorophore concentrations.},

Critical model features are: spontaneous stochastic firing of individual origins in euchromatin and facultative heterochromatin, inhibition of firing at distances below the size of chromatin loops and a domino-like effect by which replication forks induce firing of nearby origins. The model reproduces the empirical temporal and chromatin-related properties of DNA replication in human cells.

  abstract        = {This report investigates the mechanisms by which mammalian cells coordinate DNA replication with transcription and chromatin assembly. In yeast, DNA replication initiates within nucleosome-free regions, but studies in mammalian cells have not revealed a similar relationship. Here, we have used genome-wide massively parallel sequencing to map replication initiation events, thereby creating a database of all replication initiation sites within nonrepetitive DNA in two human cell lines. Mining this database revealed that genomic regions transcribed at moderate levels were generally associated with high replication initiation frequency. In genomic regions with high rates of transcription, very few replication initiation events were detected. High-resolution mapping of replication initiation sites showed that replication initiation events were absent from transcription start sites but were highly enriched in adjacent, downstream sequences. Methylation of CpG sequences strongly affected the location of replication initiation events, whereas histone modifications had minimal effects. These observations suggest that high levels of transcription interfere with formation of pre-replication protein complexes. Data presented here identify replication initiation sites throughout the genome, providing a foundation for further analyses of DNA-replication dynamics and cell-cycle progression.},

These prior experiments, focused on production of nascent DNA, have been interpreted to imply that the dynamics of replication fork progression are strongly affected by local chromatin structure/architecture, and by interaction with machineries controlling transcription, repair and epigenetic maintenance. Here, we adopted a complementary approach for assaying replication dynamics using whole genome time-resolved chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with microarray analysis of the GINS complex, an integral member of the replication fork. Surprisingly, our data show that this complex progresses at highly uniform rates regardless of genomic location, revealing that replication fork dynamics in yeast is simpler and more uniform than previously envisaged. In addition, we show how the synergistic use of experiment and modeling leads to novel biological insights. In particular, a parsimonious model allowed us to accurately simulate fork movement throughout the genome and also revealed a subtle phenomenon, which we interpret as arising from low-frequency fork arrest.},

We demonstrate that interpreting high-resolution Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome replication data with a mathematical model allows quantification of the stochastic nature of genome replication, including the efficiency of each origin and the distribution of termination events. Single-cell measurements support the inferred values for stochastic origin activation time. A strain, in which three origins were inactivated, confirmed that the distribution of termination events is primarily dictated by the stochastic activation time of origins. Cell-to-cell variability in origin activity ensures that termination events are widely distributed across virtually the whole genome. We propose that the heterogeneity in origin usage contributes to genome stability by limiting potentially deleterious events from accumulating at particular loci.},

	and two human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSCs), and compared
	them with related mouse cell types. Results confirm the conservation
	of coordinately replicated megabase-sized "replication domains" punctuated
	by origin-suppressed regions. Differentiation-induced replication
	timing changes in both species occur in 400- to 800-kb units and
	are similarly coordinated with transcription changes. A surprising
	degree of cell-type-specific conservation in replication timing was
	observed across regions of conserved synteny, despite considerable
	species variation in the alignment of replication timing to isochore
	GC/LINE-1 content. Notably, hESC replication timing profiles were
	significantly more aligned to mouse epiblast-derived stem cells (mEpiSCs)
	than to mouse ESCs. Comparison with epigenetic marks revealed a signature
	of chromatin modifications at the boundaries of early replicating
	domains and a remarkably strong link between replication timing and
	spatial proximity of chromatin as measured by Hi-C analysis. Thus,
	early and late initiation of replication occurs in spatially separate
	nuclear compartments, but rarely within the intervening chromatin.
	Moreover, cell-type-specific conservation of the replication program
	implies conserved developmental changes in spatial organization of
	chromatin. Together, our results reveal evolutionarily conserved
	aspects of developmentally regulated replication programs in mammals,
	demonstrate the power of replication profiling to distinguish closely
	related cell types, and strongly support the hypothesis that replication
	timing domains are spatially compartmentalized structural and functional

Replication timing is determined by the timing of replication origin firing, which involves activation of MCM helicase complexes loaded at replication origins. Nonetheless, how the timing of such origin firing is regulated remains mysterious. Here, we show that the number of MCMs loaded at origins regulates replication timing. We show for the first time in vivo that multiple MCMs are loaded at origins. Because early origins have more MCMs loaded, they are, on average, more likely to fire early in S phase. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed heterogeneity in origin firing and help to explain how defined replication timing profiles emerge from stochastic origin firing. These results establish a framework in which further mechanistic studies on replication timing, such as the strong effect of heterochromatin, can be pursued.},

  title    = {Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks},
  abstract = {This paper presents a speech recognition sys-tem that directly transcribes audio data with text, without requiring an intermediate phonetic repre-sentation. The system is based on a combination of the deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network architecture and the Connectionist Tem-poral Classification objective function. A mod-ification to the objective function is introduced that trains the network to minimise the expec-tation of an arbitrary transcription loss function. This allows a direct optimisation of the word er-ror rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or lan-guage model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3 % on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9 % with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2 % with a trigram language model. Combining the network with a baseline system further reduces the error rate to 6.7%. 1.},

Using in vitro prepared DNA substrates, we characterized the effect of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) substitution for thymidine on the MinION nanopore electrical signal. Using a neural-network basecaller trained on yeast DNA containing either BrdU or thymidine, we identified BrdU-labelled tracts in yeast cells synchronously entering S phase in the presence of hydroxyurea and BrdU. As expected, the BrdU-labelled tracts coincided with previously identified early-firing, but not late-firing, replication origins. These results open the way to high-throughput, high-resolution, single-molecule analysis of DNA replication in many experimental systems.},

We have generated novel OK-seq, Repli-seq and RNA-seq data to compare the DNA replication and gene expression programs of twelve cancer and non-cancer human cell types. Changes in replication fork directionality (RFD) determined by OK-seq are widespread but more frequent within GC-poor isochores and largely disconnected from transcription changes. Cancer cell RFD profiles cluster with non-cancer cells of similar developmental origin but not with different cancer types. Importantly, recurrent RFD changes are detected in specific tumour progression pathways. Using a model for establishment and early progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we identify 1027 replication initiation zones (IZs) that progressively change efficiency during long-term expression of the BCR-ABL1 oncogene, being twice more often downregulated than upregulated. Prolonged expression of BCR-ABL1 results in targeting of new IZs and accentuation of previous efficiency changes. Targeted IZs are predominantly located in GC-poor, late replicating gene deserts and frequently silenced in late CML. Prolonged expression of BCR-ABL1 results in massive deletion of GC-poor, late replicating DNA sequences enriched in origin silencing events. We conclude that BCR-ABL1 expression progressively affects replication and stability of GC-poor, late-replicating regions during CML progression.}},

  abstract     = {In human and other metazoans, the determinants of replication origin location and strength are still elusive. Origins are licensed in G1 phase and fired in S phase of the cell cycle, respectively. It is debated which of these two temporally separate steps determines origin efficiency. Experiments can independently profile mean replication timing (MRT) and replication fork directionality (RFD) genome-wide. Such profiles contain information on multiple origins{\textquoteright} properties and on fork speed. Due to possible origin inactivation by passive replication, however, observed and intrinsic origin efficiencies can markedly differ. Thus, there is a need for methods to infer intrinsic from observed origin efficiency, which is context-dependent. Here, we show that MRT and RFD data are highly consistent with each other but contain information at different spatial frequencies. Using neural networks, we infer an origin licensing landscape that, when inserted in an appropriate simulation framework, jointly predicts MRT and RFD data with unprecedented precision. We furthermore uncover an analytical formula that predicts intrinsic from observed origin efficiency combined with MRT data. Comparison of inferred intrinsic origin efficiencies with experimental profiles of licensed origins (ORC, MCM) and actual initiation events (Bubble-seq, SNS-seq, OK-seq) show that intrinsic origin efficiency is not solely determined by licensing efficiency. Thus, human replication origin efficiency is set at both the origin licensing and firing steps.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract     = {Proper control of replication timing (RT) is of vital importance to maintain genome and epigenome integrity. However, the genome-wide sequence determinants regulating RT remain unclear. Here, we develop a new machine learning method, named Concert, to simultaneously predict RT from sequence features and identify RT-modulating sequence elements in a genome-wide manner. Concert integrates two functionally cooperative modules, a selector, which performs importance estimationbased sampling to detect predictive sequence elements, and a predictor, which incorporates bidirectional recurrent neural networks and self-attention mechanism to achieve selective learning of longrange spatial dependencies across genomic loci. We apply Concert to predict RT in mouse embryonic stem cells and multiple human cell types with high accuracy. The identified RT-modulating sequence elements show novel connections with genomic and epigenomic features such as 3D chromatin interactions. In particular, Concert reveals a class of RT-modulating elements that are not transcriptional regulatory elements but are enriched with specific repetitive sequences. As a generic interpretable machine learning framework for predicting large-scale functional genomic profiles based on sequence features, Concert provides new insights into the potential sequence determinants of RT.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract     = {Recent large-scale efforts to characterize functional activity in human have produced thousands of genome-wide experiments that quantify various forms of biochemistry, such as histone modifications, protein binding, transcription, and chromatin accessibility. Although these experiments represent a small fraction of the possible experiments that could be performed, they also make human more comprehensively characterized than any other species. We propose an extension to the imputation approach Avocado that enables the model to leverage genome alignments and the large number of human genomics data sets when making imputations in other species. We found that not only does this extension result in improved imputation of mouse functional experiments, but that the extended model is able to make accurate imputations for protein binding assays that have been performed in human but not in mouse. This ability to make {\textquotedblleft}zero-shot{\textquotedblright} imputations greatly increases the utility of such imputation approaches and enables comprehensive imputations to be made for species even when experimental data are sparse.CCS CONCEPTS {\textbullet} Computing methodologies {\textrightarrow} Neural networks; Factorization methods; {\textbullet} Applied computing {\textrightarrow} Bioinformatics; Genomics.ACM Reference Format Jacob Schreiber, Deepthi Hegde, and William Noble. 2020.
